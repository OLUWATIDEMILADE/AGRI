Choose a text editor to write your code. : Visual Studio Code

Organize my files and folders for clarity and easy maintenance.

create a homepage, shop page, contact page, and cart with HTML.

Create style.css: This file will define the styles for my web page.

I made the CSS file cover all my HTML files and linked them.

 Include the <script> tag before the closing </body> tag in my HTML file.


THE JAVASCRIPT WAS USED TO LINK THE CONTACT PAGE TO FORMSPREE AND THE PAYMENT PAGE TO STRIPE THE LINKS ARE BELOW.
